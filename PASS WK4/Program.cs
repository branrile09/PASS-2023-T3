            // ----- Loops ----
            //1. while loop
            //a) explanation:            
            //b) example code (loop while meaning of life is != 42 )


            //2. Do While
            //a) explanation
            //b) example code (loop while meaning of life is != 42 )

            //3. For loop
            //a) explanation
            //b) example code (100 iterations, number starts at 1, triple it, then half it)

            //4, Foreach
            //a) explanation
            //b) example code (iterate through each char in "HiPpoPlatyroo", then output how many vowels in the word  )



            // ----- Arrays ----
            //1. Create an Array of intigers            


            //2. Create an Array of strings


            //3. Create a 2d Array of intigers size 20x20


            //4. Create a list of boolean


            //5. explain the difference between list and array
            //



            // ----- Nested Loops ----
            //1.
            // from the 2d array from earlier, assign random values between 1 and 100

            //example code for random
            Random rnd = new Random();
            int month = rnd.Next(1, 13); // creates a number between 1 and 12
            int dice = rnd.Next(1, 7); // creates a number between 1 and 6
            int card = rnd.Next(52); // creates a number between 0 and 51


            //
            //2.
            //from the 2d array from earlier, find the average.


            //using multidensional arrays can be used for all sorts of things, such as AI, Data Science, Game matrix tables, Path finding, etc
